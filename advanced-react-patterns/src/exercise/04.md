# Prop Collections and Getters

## 📝 Your Notes

Prop collection and prop getters are patterns for us to pass props from our
users onto our child components without overriding our own props and to pass on
any accessible props.

- Prop collections are an object of props that we expose to our users and allow
  them to spread onto their uis with no configuration
- Prop getters are functions that optionally accepts user's props, and composes
  them with our component's stateful props to allow the user to add aditional
  functionality

### A prop collection `togglerProps`

```javascript
function useToggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)
  return {
    on,
    toggle,
    togglerProps: {
      'aria-pressed': on,
      onClick: toggle,
    },
  }
}
```

### A prop getter `getTogglerProps`

```javascript
function useToggle() {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = () => setOn(!on)
  function getTogglerProps({onClick, ...props} = {}) {
    return {
      'aria-pressed': on,
      onClick: () => {
        onClick && onclick()
        toggle()
      },
      ...props,
    }
  }

  return {
    on,
    toggle,
    getTogglerProps,
  }
}
```

This allows us to execute our compound component's `toggle()` functionality,
while also executing any `onClick` that our user would want to execute.

```javascript
const {getToggglerProps} = useToggle()
;<button
  {...getTogglerProps({
    onClick: () => console.log('do something along with toggle() onClick'),
  })}
>
  {on ? 'on' : 'off'}
</button>
```

## Background

In typical UI components, you need to take accessibility into account. For a
button functioning as a toggle, it should have the `aria-pressed` attribute set
to `true` or `false` if it's toggled on or off. In addition to remembering that,
people need to remember to also add the `onClick` handler to call `toggle`.

Lots of the reusable/flexible components and hooks that we'll create have some
common use-cases and it'd be cool if we could make it easier to use our
components and hooks the right way without requiring people to wire things up
for common use cases.

**Real World Projects that use this pattern:**

- [downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift) (uses prop getters)
- [react-table](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table) (uses prop
  getters)
- [`@reach/tooltip`](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/tooltip) (uses prop
  collections)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/04.js)
- [Final](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.js)

In our simple example, this isn't too much for folks to remember, but in more
complex components, the list of props that need to be applied to elements can be
extensive, so it can be a good idea to take the common use cases for our hook
and/or components and make objects of props that people can simply spread across
the UI they render.

Uh oh! Someone wants to use our `togglerProps` object, but they need to apply
their own `onClick` handler! Try doing that by updating the `App` component to
this:

```javascript
function App() {
  const {on, togglerProps} = useToggle()
  return (
    <div>
      <Switch on={on} {...togglerProps} />
      <hr />
      <button
        aria-label="custom-button"
        {...togglerProps}
        onClick={() => console.info('onButtonClick')}
      >
        {on ? 'on' : 'off'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Does that work? Why not? Can you change it to make it work?

What if we change the API slightly so that instead of having an object of props,
we call a function to get the props. Then we can pass that function the props we
want applied and that function will be responsible for composing the props
together.

Let's try that. Update the `App` component to this:

```javascript
function App() {
  const {on, getTogglerProps} = useToggle()
  return (
    <div>
      <Switch {...getTogglerProps({on})} />
      <hr />
      <button
        {...getTogglerProps({
          'aria-label': 'custom-button',
          onClick: () => console.info('onButtonClick'),
          id: 'custom-button-id',
        })}
      >
        {on ? 'on' : 'off'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

See if you can make that API work.
